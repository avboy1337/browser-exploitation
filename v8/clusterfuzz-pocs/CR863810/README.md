This code currently generates a not-zero-extended value:

  8: Int64Constant[-4581644333865713373]
  10: Int32Constant[0]
  9: TruncateInt64ToInt32(8)
  11: Int32Sub(9, 10)

The instruction selector selects an X64Lea32 for node 11, and this results in this code after register allocation:
[rax|R|w32] = X64Lea32 : MRI [rax|R|w64] #0

The code generator then emits no code at all, since input and output register are the same:
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/compiler/x64/code-generator-x64.cc?l=1961

Hence, the result is still the original Int64Constant.
This also fails the AssertZeroExtended check (if --debug-code is enabled):
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/compiler/x64/code-generator-x64.cc?l=1987

This is a security bug since other instructions rely on TruncateInt64ToInt32 to always produce a zero-extended value.
