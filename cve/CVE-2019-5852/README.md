<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
Using the queryObjects console utility function, a user can find a list of objects that were created with a specific constructor (e.g. all objects created with the Promise constructor). A webpage typically can't call this function (or any other of the console utility functions), as they're only made available within the devtools console.

However, these functions are made available in certain situations. One such situation is when the user has typed a command into the console. The command will be evaluated and the evaluation environment gives the code that's run access to the utility functions.

This can allow a script on the page to call queryObjects and once it does so, it can leak the returned objects without any further interaction. This technique also gives a page some of the tools that might be needed to compromise the renderer.

<b>VERSION</b>
Chrome Version: Tested on 75.0.3770.100 (stable) and 77.0.3830.0 (canary)
Operating System: Windows 10 Pro, version 1903

<b>REPRODUCTION CASE</b>
1. The attached files form a simple website. To begin with, download each of the files and place them in a directory.
2. In the directory you downloaded the files to, run the following command in a terminal:

python3 -m http.server 8080

This will start a simple web server that can be used to serve the files in the directory.
3. In the browser, navigate to the following location:

http://localhost:8080/index.html

4. Open the devtools console. Run the following line:

window.name

5. At the bottom of the console, you should see output like the following:

Found arrayBufferConstructor_DoNotInitialize:
ArrayBuffer(100) {}
Found InternalPackedArray:
InternalPackedArray []

These messages indicate that the page has found arrayBufferConstructor_DoNotInitialize and InternalPackedArray and has created instances of both of them.
