Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Build asan 77.0.3832.0 version of chrome.Or download asan-linux-release-670818.
2. Release files from htm.zip into htm dir and put ws.js into the same level with htm dir.The directory tree looks like this
|----ws.js
|----htm  
    |----poc.html
    |----other res js file

3. Use nodejs to setup a webserver: node ws.js
(maybe you'll need to install express and websocket package:npm install express websocket)

3. Run chrome http://127.0.0.1:8605/poc.html

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
When offline audio starts rendering, it would check the pre-render task and stop rendering loop if needed. Once rendering has been suspended, the rendering thread would post a Notify task into main thread. If the audio's execution context (frame pointer from v8 context) was removed and garbage-collected while the Notify task is in the sequenceï¼Œonce the main thread runs the task, the GetExecutionContext function will visit the frame and UAP happened.

I tested it on version 77.0.3828.0, 77.0.3830.0 and 77.0.3832.0.All can repro stably.It's might be a re-opened issue of 959700.

Did this work before? N/A
