<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Turn on a specific graphics feature (section plane view) in our WebGL-based software (www.onshape.com)
2. Manipulate the view, rotate the camera, etc.
3. Shortly after, sometimes an Aw Snap tab crash will happen.

<b>What is the expected result?</b>

Tab doesn't crash

<b>What happens instead?</b>

Tab crashes (Aw Snap)

I apologize that this report does not include solid repro steps. This is a rare crash that feels like a race condition and occurs perhaps 1 of 5-10 times a specific visualization mode is used. Unfortunately the software itself (www.onshape.com) is also closed for a little while longer, but if anyone would like to work on this bug I can provide an invitation. 

This bug appears on Mac and Windows in the latest Chrome and Chromium. 

I have managed to trap the crash in Xcode in a debug Chromium build. It appears that somehow the internal v8 javascript function handle for the requestAnimationFrame callback becomes NULL. I have seen it crash the same way twice in the debugger. The crash is definitely triggered by a specific WebGL graphics feature (section view) that shows a cutaway of the model, though the causal link there is mysterious. 

I have attached a screenshot of the debugger stopped at the offending line.
