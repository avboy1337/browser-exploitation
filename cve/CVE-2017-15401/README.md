Split from bug 766253:

"""
WebAsm instance builder reads imports from an attacker-controlled object in v8/src/wasm/wasm-module.cc:1625 ProcessImports(). Imports can be getters, which run while the instance is being built and is not in a consistent state. If the getter builds another instance for the same module, then the instances will share a WasmCompiledModule, but will have different ArrayBuffers for memory. Compiled module will reference one memory buffer. If the second memory grows, then the compiled module gets confused and relocates to OOB memory. For trunk, the code has moved to wasm/module-compiler.cc. Exploit in wasm_xpl.js.
