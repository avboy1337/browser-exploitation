Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Run the following JS code in d8 as used in the specified Chrome version (SVN r18421, branch 3.23, 64 bit):

function boom() {
  var args = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < 125000; i++)
    args.push(i);
  return Array.apply(Array, args);
}
var array = boom();
function fib(n) {
  var f0 = 0, f1 = 1;
  for (; n > 0; n = n -1) {
    f0 + f1;
    f0 = array;
  }
}
fib(75);

What is the expected behavior?
No crash.

What went wrong?
d8 crashes with a GC corruption:

I was not able to reproduce this properly in my release build of Chromium, but I suspect this is due to different GC timings and with a little effort, this could be solved. A test for d8 is also likely to be more valuable to find the actual problem.

Did this work before? Yes V8 branch 3.22 seems to work fine.

Chrome version: 33.0.1750.5  Channel: dev
OS Version: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS
Flash Version: Shockwave Flash 11.2 r202

In branch 3.22 I get this weird error:

test.js:3: illegal access
  for (var i = 0; i < 125000; i++)
                               ^

instead of a crash.
