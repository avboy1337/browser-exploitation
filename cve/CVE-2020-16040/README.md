<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>

While fuzzing V8 a sample was generated that leads to the following crash:

---> Debug Build

```
	#
	# Fatal error in ../../src/builtins/builtins-array.cc, line 154
	# Debug check failed: 0 <= length && length <= kMaxSafeInteger.
	#
	#
	#
	#FailureMessage Object: 0x7ffe5e5aa4e0
```

---> Release Build

```
	Received signal 11 SEGV_ACCERR 39d60818d000

	==== C stack trace ===============================

	 [0x55fbfc1b34b7]
	 [0x7f7cde6b88a0]
	 [0x7f7cddc86025]
	 [0x55fbfb861079]

	 [0x55fbfb73fe0f]
	 [0x55fbfc0a00b8]
	[end of stack trace]
	Segmentation fault

```

I think it should be a similar Compiler issue like 1126249, the sample needs
"--allow-natives-syntax" to work as I'm using %PrepareFunctionForOptimization and
%OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall builtins.

<b>REPRODUCTION CASE</b>

Commit:

```
	2781d585038b97ed375f2ec06651dc9e5e04f916
```

I'm using builds from https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/v8-asan/index.html

Release: 

```
	d8-linux-release-v8-component-71271
```

Debug:

```
	d8-linux-debug-v8-component-71271
```


Command for repro:
	./d8 sample.js --allow-natives-syntax

It should give you an output similar to the ones described at "vulnerability details".

I'm attaching the bug as "sample.js".
