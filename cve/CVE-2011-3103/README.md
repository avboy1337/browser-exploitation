I got these crashes on Windows:
http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=ee8aaf84d1a81e17 <- slightly different stack
http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=ea39e1eb7fd94a6e
http://crash/reportdetail?reportid=ee8aaf84d1a81fb2
I also got one on Linux64 "19.0.1055.1 (Official Build 123982) dev" but didn't have crash reporting on.

while visiting this page:
http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/03/07/the-story-behind-the-nokia-808-pureview/
(one of the reports lists flickr as the current URL, but I had the nokia page open in another tab and I think it shared a process.

The crash happens randomly while on the page. Sometimes it happens soon after load, sometimes it happens after a many minutes (the first time it happened I almost read the whole article).
