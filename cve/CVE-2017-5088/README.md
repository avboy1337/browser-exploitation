<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>

There is a out of boundary issue in v8::wasm::module-decoder, which will disclosure sensitive information in the heap.

In v8\src\wasm\module-decoder.cc, the function next(), DecodeModule(), and DecodeCustomSections() doesn't handle the custom section properly.

In next(), 
		if (section_code_ == kUnknownSectionCode &&
		  section_end_ > decoder_.pc()) {
		// skip to the end of the unknown section.
		uint32_t remaining =
			static_cast<uint32_t>(section_end_ - decoder_.pc());
		decoder_.consume_bytes(remaining, "section payload");
		// fall through and continue to the next section.
		} else {
		return;
		}
Here if section_end_ <= decoder_.pc, the iterator simply exit. The section_code_ remains be kUnknownSectionCode.

Then in function DecodeModule(),
		if (section_iter.more() && ok()) {
		      errorf(pc(), "unexpected section: %s",
                         SectionName(section_iter.section_code()));
		}
Because section_code_ is kUnknownSectionCode, here will not trigger the errorf and everything is OK.

Then in DecodeCustomSections(), all the data will be treated as checked, and simply run through.
So if we put a large section_length here, the payload_length will go out of the buffer boundary.
