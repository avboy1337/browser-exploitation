Chrome Version       : 29.0.1547.57
URLs (if applicable) : none
<b>Other browsers tested:</b>
     Safari 6: OK
  Firefox 20: OK
       IE 8/9/10: OK
  Chrome 29.0.1547.62: FAIL
  Chrome 29.0.1547.57 and .62 if code is stepped through in debugger: OK

<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Open the attached file ChromeTest.html in Chrome 29.  This file contains a javascript function that recursively wraps any non-function properties of an object with a function expression (function () { return value; }).  It then tests the returned object with some assertions to see if the mapped object contains the expected values.

<b>What is the expected result?</b>
All assertions should pass.  They do on FF, IE and Safari.  They also do in Chrome 29 if you step through the code in the debugger.  Only if you let it run does it display the issue.  Optimization and/or JIT bug?

<b>What happens instead?</b>
Two of the assertions fail, regarding a property (B) that was a function to start with but which is now mysteriously set to the value of the next property processed, and that next property (C), which becomes undefined.

Discussion/Discovery
We were contacted by our users saying several applications we wrote using knockout.js had started failing after Chrome autoupdated to version 29.0.1547.57.  After some probing, we found that the specific problem was with knockout's mapping plugin.  If you're not familiar with that plugin, it recursively converts the properties of an object to knockout's ko.observable type, so that they may be bound to the DOM.  With Chrome 29, some of the properties were being scrambled (coming back with values from different properties), and some were coming back undefined.  The plugin works correctly in all other browsers which we have tested.

We started paring down the plugin until we could find the smallest case that would repro the issue, which is the attached file.

Also attached is a screenshot of a Chrome Dev tools session showing where the assertions fail.
