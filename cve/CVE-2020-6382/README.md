Steps to reproduce the problem:
The following PoC found by fuzzing crashes v8 8.0.0 with a trap.
Run with the debug build of d8.

function opt() {
  var arr = [0, 0, 0];
  var j = 11;
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    if (i == 90) {
      i = j.toPrecision().trimLeft();
      ++arr[i];
      arr[Math.atan(i)] = 1;
    }
  }
}

function main() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    opt();
  }
}

main();

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
Run in gdb, we can get:

Thread 1 "d8" received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x00007e8a14e42dba in ?? ()

(gdb) x/4i $pc-0x7
   0x7e8a14e42db3:      jne    0x7e8a14e42f75
   0x7e8a14e42db9:      int3
=> 0x7e8a14e42dba:      xor    %r11d,%r11d
   0x7e8a14e42dbd:      push   %r11

From our study, we think this should be different issue from 1028862.
