Steps to reproduce the problem:
The following PoC found by fuzzing crashes both release and debug build of v8 8.0.0 (commit a5376b7e8f647b69184c54462e48e2a4423aff44 on Nov 11th)

PoC:

function opt() {
  var date = new Date();
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    switch (i / date.getMilliseconds()) {
      case 0:
      case date.getMilliseconds() % i:
        break;
    }
  }
}

function main() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i--) {
    opt();
  }
}

main();

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
Run in gdb with the PoC, we get:

Thread 1 "d8" received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x00007e8b96d42c4b in ?? ()
(gdb) x/4i $pc - 0x7
