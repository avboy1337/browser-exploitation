<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
When lazily parsing function the allow_natives_syntax flag is always set for those functions. The preparser doesn't report invalid use of natives syntax, so within functions arbitrary natives can be called if preparsing is enabled (source file > 1024 byte). The native functions expose V8 internal functionality which could be exploited.
