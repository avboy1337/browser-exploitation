<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
The HTML file attached (containing two JavaScripts) crashes Chrome 16 and V8 shell (d8 with the two scripts on command line) on heap with an invalid write.

NOTE: The test uses gc(), so you need --js-flags="-expose-gc" for the browser, respectively --expose-gc for d8. I did not test Chromium 15 because my builds of Chromium don't have the --js-flags option for some reason.

<b>VERSION</b>
Chrome Version: 16.0.899.0 dev
Operating System: Ubuntu 11.04, tested on 64 bit

<b>REPRODUCTION CASE</b>
See attached HTML file.
