This is a dupe of 681761. I rewrote it to follow the security template, sorry :).

<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
During Array.concat() the `visitor` variable is created which is what is returned after the function is complete. The type of the `visitor` variable is determined by the first argument sent to `Array.prototype.concat.call`.

When the objects being passed to concat are being placed into `visitor`, if the visitor function is not a fixed_array() `JSReceiver::CreateDataProperty` is called. This function can trigger callbacks in some instances.

When `JSReceiver::CreateDataProperty` is called on a JSProxy, after a long line of functions, eventually `JSProxy::DefineOwnProperty` is called which calls `Object::GetMethod` on the `defineProperty` property (`Object::GetMethod` triggers getters). It is possible to trigger this callback
during Array.concat() by setting a getter `Object.prototype.__defineGetter__("defineProperty", evil_callback)`.

In this callback we can change the size of the `visitor` object in the middle of it's iteration. When this is paired with garbage collection it leads to on out of bounds read.

In the comment below I go into more detail about how these functions get called with specific lines of code and function names.

note: There is DCHECK() in place to check for OOB in debug builds but this is disabled for Release builds

<b>REPRODUCTION CASE</b>
I have included a few proofs of concept,
poc1.html <--- This demonstrates the OOB read primitive to get a memory leak off the v8 heap
poc2.html <--- Demonstrates a reliable crash
poc3.html <--- memory leak with floats converted to hex

<b>FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b>
Type of crash: renderer process
I have attached the output from debug running poc2.html in crash.log with DCHECK turned off
